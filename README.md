# Traffic congestion reduction in SUMO using Reinforcement Learning Method
This is a research project aiming to find batter method to reduse traffic congestion. The whole experement was performed in a simulation software called SUMO. Four algorithm has been implemented in this research. They are,
1) Q-learning
2) SARSA
3) Greedy Aproach
4) Bias Q-learning

Q-learning and SARSA are two renowned algorithm. Greedy Approach is just finding the most traffic and opening the road. Bias Q-learning is the most interesting one. Manupulating the q-function a significant change is observed. 

Comparing all the algorithm with each other with respect to simulation time, waiting car and waiting vehicles a conclution is made.
