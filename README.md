# Traffic congestion reduction in SUMO using Reinforcement Learning Method
This is a research project aiming to find a better method to reduce traffic congestion. The whole experiment was performed in a simulation software called SUMO. Four algorithms have been implemented in this research. They are,
1) Q-learning
2) SARSA
3) Greedy Approach
4) Bias Q-learning

Q-learning and SARSA are two renowned algorithms. The greedy Approach is just finding the most traffic and opening the road. Bias Q-learning is the most interesting one. Manipulating the q-function a significant change is observed. 

Comparing all the algorithms with each other with respect to simulation time, the number of waiting cars, and waiting vehicles a conclusion is made.
